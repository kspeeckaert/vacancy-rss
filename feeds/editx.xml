GIS-experten, beleidsmedewerkers, ruimtelijke planners, wetenschappers in standaard desktop en online GIS-toepassingen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Om aan de diversiteit van het gebruik te kunnen voldoen, is interoperabiliteit en standaardisatie van deze services ontzettend belangrijk.

Hierbij verdiep je je en begrijp je voor een aantal specifieke producten de exacte vraag, knelpunten, bestaande noden, opportuniteiten en informatiebehoeften van klanten, stakeholders en eindgebruikers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je bent verantwoordelijk om zicht te houden op de waarde van de producten (inhoudelijk, technisch en functioneel) en detecteert nieuwe productkansen voor de betrokken organisatie en haar partners.

Daarbij handel je proactief en in het belang van de organisatie. Je bent een betrouwbare partner voor collega’s, stakeholders en opdrachtgevers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leergierigheid en werken naar de vastgelegde doelstellingen met de nodige zin voor ondernemen en initiatief liggen in lijn met jouw persoonlijkheid.
